 

* a MUSH for the modern age... a more visually/intuitively interactive system, easily used on mobile
* A significant part would still be chat.  You would see a description of the room you're in, a list of people and objects, and a chat window of the current
  content in the room.  You would see the exits in a visual format, with the option to click on them to travel.  Clicking on a person or object would allow you
  to select an interaction

* urls would signify where you are, and could be passed around for ... some reason
* possibly audio playing live? (this could be abused of course)
* music + background image for part of screen, to set the mood of the location
* customizable css files, which could be stored on the server and downloaded only to the authorized user.  It shouldn't require protections because it's
  all client side.

* have a profile page which makes it easy to change things about you




* add user registration

* make input autofocus
* websocket reconnects when you refresh the browser window.  Is there a way to prevent that on reload?
* add a way of dismissing the 'details' view, without interfering with the editing of fields
* objects are loaded multiple times, when they shouldn't be
* add periodic object saver


* a lot of commands fail with 'I don't understand' because it doesn't parse them to figure out the intended thing, like /pickup thing
  should return 'I don't see that here' rather than 'I don't understand'
* you need to deal with the capitals/lower case thing.  Either names must be lowercase, or names should be made lowercase for action log messages
* add aliasing and/or partial, case-insensitive matching of names
* allow partial and alternate command names?

* add way to delete an object with a command
* add a check to make sure an object is dereferenced for deletion? or add a garbage collection phase, scheduled periodically

* add parameters.  Anything more than just a target select could enter the command on the command line for completion
* allow /give biscut to person
* add a command to add attributes, and add functions... it would be for wizards only, and maybe would be a separate editor somewhere/somehow


* give
* whisper
* stand? sit? or should you do fully customizable poses?
* follow/unfollow
* favorite location (and have menu at top)



RPG:
* eat/drink
* kill/attack/stop
* wear/hold/weild
* search/traps
* open/close/lock/pick/knock
* steal/sneak/backstab/sneak
* spells/cast
* learn/train/etc
* store, where you list items for sale, and other users can view, buy, offer



* 'leash' the ducky, which makes it follow you, and also somehow makes it so that in descriptions, it shows you holding the leash... so it makes it
  clear to others (this is just an example for an effect that crosses beings)
