 

* a MUSH for the modern age... a more visually/intuitively interactive system, easily used on mobile
* A significant part would still be chat.  You would see a description of the room you're in, a list of people and objects, and a chat window of the current
  content in the room.  You would see the exits in a visual format, with the option to click on them to travel.  Clicking on a person or object would allow you
  to select an interaction

* urls would signify where you are, and could be passed around for ... some reason
* possibly audio playing live? (this could be abused of course)
* music + background image for part of screen, to set the mood of the location
* customizable css files, which could be stored on the server and downloaded only to the authorized user.  It shouldn't require protections because it's
  all client side.

* have a profile page which makes it easy to change things about you




* make input autofocus

* add way to delete an object with a command
* add a check to make sure an object is dereferenced for deletion? or add a garbage collection phase, scheduled periodically
* reuse object ids when allocating new objects
* fix the hack during load where we assume the last object is the newest object; instead allow a constructor argument to set the id (maybe only if id is not used)
* add an object clone command
* maybe use es5 prototypes instead of es6 classes???

* add a command to add attributes, and add functions... it would be for wizards only, and maybe would be a separate editor somewhere/somehow
* allow partial and alternate command names?

* add command parser to root or something, so you can call verbs properly
* add a back command so you can easily go back to where you were, or make it work with back buttons
* there is an issue with /go #id, where the parser executes go on #id, when it should execute go on player.location.  Before I was having an
  issue with /hug player such that it was hugging the player first rather than hugging the ducky =/


* you need to deal with the capitals/lower case thing.  Either names must be lowercase, or names should be made lowercase for action log messages
* add parameters.  Anything more than just a target select could enter the command on the command line for completion
* add support for dot names in attributes, so that you can edit 'style.icon', etc


* what about fancy features, like images, background images, ui effects, colour animations
* add notifications for activity in the current room, and maybe a way to filter only certain events
* should it be possible to change the css rules for everything in the viewbox; so if you have a background that makes text hard to read, you can change that while
  still using the class of the text to know what colour to choose


* whisper
* stand? sit? or should you do fully customizable poses?
* follow/unfollow
* favorite location (and have menu at top)
* add/remove aliases
* move exits up/down
* who



RPG:
* eat/drink
* kill/attack/stop
* wear/hold/weild
* search/traps
* open/close/lock/pick/knock
* steal/sneak/backstab/sneak
* spells/cast
* learn/train/etc
* store, where you list items for sale, and other users can view, buy, offer



* 'leash' the ducky, which makes it follow you, and also somehow makes it so that in descriptions, it shows you holding the leash... so it makes it
  clear to others (this is just an example for an effect that crosses beings)
