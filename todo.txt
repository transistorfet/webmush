 

* a MUSH for the modern age... a more visually/intuitively interactive system, easily used on mobile
* A significant part would still be chat.  You would see a description of the room you're in, a list of people and objects, and a chat window of the current
  content in the room.  You would see the exits in a visual format, with the option to click on them to travel.  Clicking on a person or object would allow you
  to select an interaction

* urls would signify where you are, and could be passed around for ... some reason
* possibly audio playing live? (this could be abused of course)
* music + background image for part of screen, to set the mood of the location
* customizable css files, which could be stored on the server and downloaded only to the authorized user.  It shouldn't require protections because it's
  all client side.

* have a profile page which makes it easy to change things about you


* how will you store data?
* should you store objects as pointers or as a universal reference


* add user registration
* make input autofocus
* add up/down arrows to input for history of commands


* add drop success, drop fail, take success, take fail, etc messages to objects.. and add acceptable, etc checks, same for moveto/go
* a lot of commands fail with 'I don't understand' because it doesn't parse them to figure out the intended thing, like /pickup thing
  should return 'I don't see that here' rather than 'I don't understand'
* websocket reconnects when you refresh the browser window.  Is there a way to prevent that on reload?


* add editable fields
* add editable_for(player) function
* add parameters.  Anything more than just a target select could enter the command on the command line for completion


* give
* whisper
* stand? sit? or should you do fully customizable poses?
* follow/unfollow
* favorite location (and have menu at top)
