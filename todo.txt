 

* a MUSH for the modern age... a more visually/intuitively interactive system, easily used on mobile

* urls would signify where you are, and could be passed around for ... some reason
* linking would be easy and integrated into the experience
* possibly audio playing live? (this could be abused of course)

* customizable css files, which could be stored on the server and downloaded only to the authorized user.  It shouldn't require protections because it's
  all client side.

* A significant part would still be chat.  You would see a description of the room you're in, a list of people and objects, and a chat window of the current
  content in the room.  You would see the exits in a visual format, with the option to click on them to travel.  Clicking on a person or object would allow you
  to select an interaction
* shortcut commands would still be included to make navigation easier for desktop users

* have a profile page which makes it easy to change things about you


* how will you store data?
* should you store objects as pointers or as a universal reference


* only one connection is allowed at a time, but the server side never nulls the connection, nor checks to see if a
  connection exists before connecting a new client
